## Codex 實作工作日誌｜2026-06-05

### Done

- Created the local `shenghai` repository structure.
- Researched score file format direction.
- Chose MusicXML as the main interchange format.
- Chose Shenghai ScoreDocument JSON as the internal wrapper.
- Confirmed Java is installed locally.
- Confirmed Audiveris, MuseScore, and FluidSynth are not currently installed.
- Added a MusicXML to ScoreDocument/MIDI prototype.
- Created the private GitHub repository `Chein-Shawn/shenghai` in the browser.
- Created a local Git repository and committed the initial research workspace.
- Attempted to push to GitHub; push is blocked until GitHub private-repo authentication or connector installation is granted.
- Attempted to clone Audiveris source for OMR research; clone failed with `fatal: early EOF`, so OMR is still blocked on acquiring Audiveris.
- Installed OpenJDK 21 via Homebrew for Audiveris/Gradle experimentation.
- Successfully cloned Audiveris `development` branch with `--depth 1` into `/private/tmp/audiveris-dev`.
- Successfully ran `./gradlew tasks` with OpenJDK 21 and confirmed the Audiveris CLI options include `-batch`, `-transcribe`, `-export`, and `-output`.
- Attempted Audiveris batch OMR on `chula.png`; build failed because the development branch uses Java source release 25, while OpenJDK 21 is installed.
- Added `research/omr/run_audiveris_baseline.sh` to preserve the exact OMR command once a compatible Audiveris build/JDK is available.
- Added `ios-app/ShenghaiCore`, an Xcode-openable Swift package for iOS 17+ and macOS 14+.
- Implemented Swift `ScoreDocument`, `MusicXMLImporter`, and `MIDIWriter` as the first shared Apple-platform core.
- Added Swift tests for simple MusicXML import and MIDI generation.
- Re-ran the Python prototype and confirmed it still writes `samples/musicxml/twinkle.scoredocument.json` and `samples/audio/twinkle.mid`.

### Current Prototype

The prototype proves this downstream path:

```text
MusicXML -> ScoreDocument JSON -> MIDI
```

It does not yet perform PDF/image OMR. OMR requires installing or otherwise accessing Audiveris.

### Next

- Grant GitHub connector access to `Chein-Shawn/shenghai` or configure local GitHub credentials, then push the local repo.
- Use a stable Audiveris release/master branch or install JDK 25, then run `research/omr/run_audiveris_baseline.sh`.
- Prepare 1-3 legal sample score PDFs/images.
- Run OMR baseline and export MusicXML.
- Compare OMR output against expected notes and measures.
- Connect the research output to an Xcode multiplatform app.

### Current Blockers

- Audiveris OMR automation needs a stable Audiveris release or JDK 25. The development branch fails on OpenJDK 21 with `invalid source release: 25`.
- SwiftPM tests could not run inside the current Codex sandbox because SwiftPM attempted to use blocked user-level caches and nested sandboxing. An escalated local `swift test` request was rejected by the current usage limit, so Swift validation is pending.
- GitHub remote backup is one commit behind local until network/push permission is available again.
- Google Doc appendix has been prepared locally, but appending it to the end of the existing Google Doc still needs a confirmed editor cursor location or a working Google Docs editing connector.
